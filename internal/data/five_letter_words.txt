# Word List Design Philosophy
#
# This list is intentionally frozen and will not be modified to ensure deterministic
# behavior for users who rely on it.
#
# Purpose: The words are chosen to be professional, neutral, and easily pronounceable.
# They serve as memorable, human-friendly components when combined with other ID formats
# (e.g., proquints, NanoIDs), making complex identifiers easier to communicate verbally.
#
# The selection criteria are intentionally conservative to avoid potentially offensive,
# inappropriate, or ambiguous terms.
# See: https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/43210/files
#
# This feature is NOT intended to generate "funny" or "clever" identifiers. Its sole
# purpose is to provide clear, professional, and unambiguous tokens for naming resources.
