  Generates a random word identifier
  This data source generates random words based on this five-letter word list https://github.com/iilei/terraform-provider-idgen/tree/master/internal/data/five_letter_words.txt. Sequential numeric seeds (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) produce words in sequential alphabetical order from the word list. To avoid this pattern, include non-numeric characters in your seed (e.g., project-1, project-2), which will be hashed for more randomized distribution. Never use seeded IDs for security tokens, passwords, or cryptographic purposes.

# idgen_random_word (Data Source)

Generates a random word identifier

This data source generates random words based on [this five-letter word list](https://github.com/iilei/terraform-provider-idgen/tree/master/internal/data/five_letter_words.txt). Sequential numeric seeds (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) produce words in sequential alphabetical order from the word list. To avoid this pattern, include non-numeric characters in your seed (e.g., `project-1`, `project-2`), which will be hashed for more randomized distribution. Never use seeded IDs for security tokens, passwords, or cryptographic purposes.

## Schema

### Optional

- `seed` (String) Optional seed for deterministic word selection. The same seed always produces the same word.

- **Numeric strings** (e.g., `"1"`, `"2"`, `"3"`) - Used directly as the index selector, producing words in sequential alphabetical order
- **Non-numeric strings** (e.g., `"project-a"`, `"env-prod"`) - Hashed to produce a distributed index selector for more varied word selection
- **Omitted** - Generates a random word that changes on each Terraform apply

**WARNING:** Seeded identifiers are predictable and should never be used for passwords, tokens, or any security-sensitive values.
- `wordlist` (String) Optional custom word list to select words from. Provide a comma-separated string of words (e.g., `apple,banana,cherry,date`). If omitted, the default five-letter word list is used.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The generated RandomWord.
