# idgen_random_word (Data Source)

Generates a random word identifier

**Important:** The bundled word list contains only 20 five-letter words, providing limited randomness. This list is intentionally small and serves merely as an example. It will not be maintained or expanded for the reasons described in the [word list philosophy](https://github.com/iilei/terraform-provider-idgen/tree/master/internal/data/five_letter_words.txt). For more control, provide your own custom `wordlist` with sufficient entropy for your needs.

## Schema

### Optional

- `seed` (String) Optional seed for deterministic word selection. The same seed always produces the same word.

- **Numeric strings** (e.g., `"1"`, `"2"`, `"3"`) - Used directly as the index selector, producing words in sequential alphabetical order
- **Non-numeric strings** (e.g., `"project-a"`, `"env-prod"`) - Hashed to produce a distributed index selector for more varied word selection
- **Omitted** - Generates a random word that changes on each Terraform apply

**WARNING:** Seeded identifiers are predictable and should never be used for passwords, tokens, or any security-sensitive values.
- `wordlist` (String) Optional custom word list to select words from. Provide a comma-separated string of words (e.g., `apple,banana,cherry,date`). If omitted, the default five-letter word list is used.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The generated RandomWord.
