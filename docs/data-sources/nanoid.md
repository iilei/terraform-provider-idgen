# idgen_nanoid (Data Source)

Generates a NanoID identifier.

**Security Notice:** When using `seed`, IDs become deterministic and predictable. Never use seeded IDs for security tokens, passwords, or cryptographic purposes.

## Schema

### Optional

- `alphabet` (String) The alphabet to use for ID generation. Can be 'alphanumeric' (a-zA-Z0-9), 'numeric' (0-9), 'readable' (excludes confusing chars like 0/O, 1/l/I), or a custom string of characters.
- `group_size` (Number) Number of characters per group, separated by dashes. If not set, no grouping is applied.
- `length` (Number) The length of the generated ID. Defaults to 21.
- `seed` (String) Optional seed for deterministic ID generation. Behavior:

- **Integer** - parsed and used as random seed
- **Text string** - hashed deterministically and used as random seed
- **Omitted** - cryptographically random (different each apply)

**WARNING:** Seeded IDs are deterministic and should not be used for security tokens or secrets.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The generated NanoID.
