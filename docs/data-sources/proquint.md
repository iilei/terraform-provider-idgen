# idgen_proquint (Data Source)

Generates a random Proquint identifier with configurable length.

This data source generates proquint-formatted IDs with random content. For canonical encoding of IPv4 addresses or uint32 integers, use `idgen_proquint_canonical` instead.

**Security Notice:** When using `seed`, IDs become deterministic and predictable. Never use seeded IDs for security tokens, passwords, or cryptographic purposes.

## Schema

### Required

- `length` (Number) The length of the generated ID in characters.

Common values: `11` (2 words, e.g., `lusab-babad`), `17` (3 words), `23` (4 words).

### Optional

- `group_size` (Number) Number of characters per group, separated by dashes. If not set, no grouping is applied.
- `seed` (String) Optional seed for deterministic random generation. Accepts any string value:

- **Text string** (e.g., `my-app-seed-42`) - hashed deterministically and used as random seed
- **Integer string** (e.g., `12345`) - parsed and used as random seed
- **Omitted** - uses cryptographically secure random generation (different each apply)

**Note:** For canonical encoding of IPv4 addresses or uint32/uint64 integers, use `idgen_proquint_canonical` instead.

**WARNING:** Seeded IDs are deterministic and should not be used for security tokens or secrets.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The generated Proquint.
